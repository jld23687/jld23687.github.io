<h2>Why adopt a dog from a shelter as opposed to a pet store?</h2>
<p>Shelters all over the country are practically bursting at the seams with a surplus of stray dogs and cats in need of loving homes. An estimated <a href=https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics>6.5 million</a> domesticated animals enter the U.S. animal shelters each year. However, because many shelters are often overrun with excess animals, and because many receive poor funding and resources, approximately <a href=https://www.aspca.org/animal-homelessness/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics>1.5 million</a> shelter animals are euthanized each year. 
</p>

<p> Not only that, but the animals in most commercial pet stores come from puppy mills, which are essentially factories for the manufacturing of puppies of “desirable” breeds. From birth to their placement in a pet store window, most of these animals are severely mistreated, malnourished, and live in generally poor conditions. As a result of overbreeding, many animals from these mills have severe health complications that owners are often not informed of at the time of adoption.

<h2>I want to adopt, but how to I know where to go or which animal is right for me?</h2>
<p>Adoption is a commitment, so first you want to make sure that you’re prepared for the responsibilities that come with pet ownership. If you are absolutely committed to adopting an animal, you can then browse local shelters, or even utilize online rescue services such as petfinder.com to see adoption listings. When you meet a pet that you might be interested in adopting, make sure to ask the shelter staff/foster parent(s) about any special needs, personality traits, or other concerns you might have regarding that animal. Once you’re convinced you’ve found your forever companion, you’re ready to adopt! Take a look at my own rescue dog (pictured below), she’s simply adorable! How could you resist that face?
